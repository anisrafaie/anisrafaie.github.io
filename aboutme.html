When I was at form 4, I take technical course. Which is I study about Engineering Drawing and Engineering Technology. I feel lucky when I get that course because that one of my ambiton to be engineer. Unfortunately, after SPM's result is out I cannot continue with my ambition as I get Failed on Addmath bacause I have to get atleast Credit to I further my study to Unversity or Polytechnic on Engineering course. Yup, a little bit sad but what can I do as that is not my destiny.
